# Argos AI Adventure
A text based adventure game written with GitHub Copilot

The goal of this project is to generate code using GitHub Copilot, a code generation language model, with human help for oversight and high level direction. The thinking is that "Quantity has a Quality of its own" and even if the code generated by GitHub CoPilot is low quality it can be generated at a relatively low cost.

Contributions welcome! (from humans or AIs or any combination of the two)
